# Exercism.io Code Exercises #

I've been working my way through the code exercises on [exercism.io](http://exercism.io) as a daily practice or code katas. 

[exercism.io](http://exercism.io) is a series of programming exercises in multiple languages in which you are given a problem and a series of unit tests to verify your solution to the problem. Once you have solved the problem, you submit your answer to [exercism.io](http://exercism.io) and it is reviewed by your peers. It is an excellent practice in Test Driven Development and a great opportunity to write code that solves a problem as simply as possible while keeping it readable and expressive.

So far, there are exercises available in available in Clojure, CoffeeScript, C++, C#, Elixir, Erlang, F#, Go, Haskell, JavaScript, Lua, Objective-C, OCaml, Perl 5, Python, Ruby, Scala, and Swift. To start, I am concentrating on the languages that are available in Visual Studio, but will likely branch out to explore some of the other languages that I am interested in.
